#What is the AppSteroid Console, and why do I care? 

The AppSteroid console allows you to manage these major categories.

1. Your application details, including keys, certificates, and tokens.
2. The content your users generated, including forums, and videos.
3. Leaderboards, and events.
4. View user analytics, and export other server side data.
5. Perform customer service tasks for your end users.
6. Manage additional team members to access the console.
7. Billing information.



##Quick Start:  How do I get my app working, and connecting to AppSteroid?

After logging in, at the Apps Dashboard, click on the large Plus symbol, to Add New App.  In the New App Dialog, type in the name of your App.  Select a .JPG that you would like to use as the Icon for your App.  And lastly, select a Genres for your App.

This will take you to your Applications Page.  Ensure that the application you have just created is the one that is selected in the upper left hand corner of the screen.

You should be on the “Dashboard” screen, and you can see the ID, and Secret Token of your application.  This App ID is the Uuid that is required by the AppSteroid SDK to communicate with the backend service.  You must ensure that these are included in your APP.  You can find more explicit instructions on how to do this in the SDK documents.  Look at the file called GetStarted.md for your specific SDK.

At this point, you have basic functionality of AppSteroid in.  If you want push notifications, CSR support features, and some other tweaks to improve your user experience keep reading.  But this may be a good place to just test that your Application actually works, and can connect to the AppSteroid Back end services.

Additional metrics, such as # of users, number of forum threads, number of Videos, and playback counts are also found here on this page.



####Forum
The forum pane allows you to moderate all the forum threads that have been posted by your users.  The Forum only has two levels of data.  The main thread, and comments to the thread.  There are no comments to comments.  In fact the first comment in a thread, is the main thread comment.  The forum threads are listed in order of the most recent comment to the thread.  Not the most recent creation of the thread.  You can create/delete threads or comments from this pane.  You can also play the video’s, and see the images posted by just clicking on the thumbnail of the content.  You can also view the posters user information, by clicking on his name or icon.  (See User Information below).

######How to navigate the forum?
You can select how many you want to view by clicking on the “View” button on the upper right of the screen.  To see the comments to the thread just click on the show comments button next to the thread.  For very long comments, you have to click on “Edit” to see the comment.  If you are viewing the comments, and want to go back to the listing of threads, click on the breadcrumb “Forum” at the top of the pane.

######New Threads, and Comments

####Videos
This page will show you all the video’s uploaded to AppSteroid, regardless of what their ultimate destination is (aka. “Reference”). 

If you want to Upload videos because your game doesn’t have the feature to automatically download them yet, you can do this by clicking on the New Video button in the Upper Right corner of the Screen.
  
You can view the Author of the video by clicking on their name, or icon.  You can also watch the video by clicking on it, or by selecting the Play button on the far right.  If the video was posted to a forum, you can click on the word “Forum” next to the video, and be taken straight to the forum comment that the video was posted on.  You can also Download, and/or delete the video, by clicking on the small down arrow next to the “Play” button on the far right.  You can navigate the video pages using the pagination controls on the bottom, and by changing the “view” number on the top right portion of the pane.



####Messages
Allows you too see and modify how APNS, and GPNS work.  From this pane you can send direct messages, or automate the sending of them.

######Direct Messages
To send a push notification manually, click on the “Send a Message” button on the far left.  This will pop up a dialog allowing you to edit this information.

  * Subject: is what the user will see as the subject of the push notification.
  * Text: is the body of the push message, what they will see after they decide to read it.
  * User Group: is whom you want the message to go out to.  If you select a users group, it will tell you the definition of this group, for example “New Users” are people that have installed the game 1-3 days.
  * Send Date: You can choose between right now, or a future time.  
  * Create / Cancel: If you click on create, this push notification will go out immediately, if it was scheduled for now.  Make sure you don’t have any typos, errors in bad judgement, etc.  Your content is now live.

#####Automated Direct Messages
Works similarly to Direct Messages, only it will keep sending these messages as the users move into the new User Group.  To create a new Automated Direct message, click on “Schedule an Automated Direct Message”.  These automated messages keep going until you decide to delete them.  To delete a scheduled automated direct message, click on the down arrow to the right of the “Edit” button, and select delete.  If you want to change the content, or timing of the message you can also edit this, by pressing the “edit “ button.

####Leaderboards
If you haven’t read about Leaderboards, you can read about them here for iOS https://github.com/fresvii/appsteroid-sdk-ios-documents/blob/master/en/GetStarted/GetStarted-Leaderboard.md and here for Unity.  The important thing to note if you didn’t read those, is that Leaderboards work on a weekly basis.  And events are a different grouping of leaderboards.  You can have multiple leaderboards for you App.  All scores are kept, and the “Leaderboard”, is just a particular view and sorting order of all the scores in that leaderboards time period.

This will show you the leaderboard ranked in the configuration chosen for that leaderboard.  If you wish to change the configuration of that leaderboard, you need to click on the leaderboard tab, and then click on Edit.  Clicking on the “Scores” tab will show you all the “scores” recorded that are selected for evaluation by that particular leaderboard you have selected.

######Events
Events are a different temporal view of a leaderboard.  It also included a banner and a description of the event.



###Users
There are two main views of users.  The active users simply called “users”, and the banned users.  Banned users is just a filter, as if a user is banned, they will still show up in the users pane.  To access a bunch of CSR controls, you will want to push the CSR button at the top right of the pane.  It is documented below.

######Users and Banned Users
There are a lot of things that you can do from these pages, but the behavior is the same regardless if you are in banned or not.  Each person that has used the game will be here.  You can search for the user by using the search box in the left side of the Users Pane.  Pagination controls are on the bottom of the pane.  You can click on column headings to sort by those particularly values.  If you click on the small down arrow next to the Show User button, you can:
